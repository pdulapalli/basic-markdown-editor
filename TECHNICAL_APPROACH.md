# Technical Approach: Command Pattern Markdown Editor

## Overview

This project demonstrates a sophisticated Markdown editor implementation using the **Command Pattern** for undo/redo functionality, with advanced **smart batching** to group related edits into logical units. Built with **Svelte** and **TypeScript**, it showcases enterprise-grade software architecture patterns in a web-based Markdown editing application with live preview capabilities.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Text Editing
- **Real-time text editing** with immediate visual feedback
- **Character-level precision** for all text operations
- **Cursor position management** with proper state synchronization
- **Selection-based operations** for formatting commands

### Command Pattern Implementation
- **Every user action becomes a command object** that can be executed and undone
- **Granular undo/redo** that works on logical editing units, not individual keystrokes
- **Command history tracking** with timestamps and descriptions
- **Extensible command system** for easy addition of new operations

### Smart Batching System
- **Time-based batching** (700ms timeout) for grouping rapid edits
- **Action-type detection** that separates insert, delete, and format operations
- **Position-jump awareness** that splits batches on non-consecutive edits
- **Manual finalization triggers** on focus loss, paste, and explicit actions

### Markdown Editing & Preview
- **Live Markdown preview** with real-time HTML rendering
- **Dual-pane interface** with editor on left, preview on right
- **Markdown syntax support** (headers, lists, links, code blocks, emphasis)
- **Scroll synchronization** between editor and preview panes

### User Experience
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y, Markdown-specific shortcuts)
- **Markdown toolbar** with syntax insertion controls and undo/redo buttons
- **Responsive dual-pane layout** with resizable splitter
- **Accessibility support** with ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility

## Technical Implementation

### Command Pattern Design
- **Command Interface**: Standardized execute/undo contract for all operations
- **Immutable Operations**: Commands capture all necessary state for reliable undo
- **Composition**: Complex operations built from simple command primitives
- **Batching**: Related commands grouped into logical units for better UX

### Smart Batching Algorithm
```typescript
finalizeBatch() triggers:
1. Time threshold exceeded (700ms pause)
2. Action type changes (insert → delete → markdown)
3. Position jumps (non-consecutive edits)
4. Manual triggers (blur, paste, save)
5. Batch size limits (50 commands max)
```

### State Management
- **Reactive Stores**: Svelte stores provide automatic UI updates
- **Centralized State**: EditorState owns all text content and cursor data
- **Immutable Updates**: All state changes go through command system
- **Store Synchronization**: UI components subscribe to relevant state slices

### Markdown Architecture
- **Plain Text Storage**: Editor content stored as plain Markdown text
- **Real-time Parsing**: Markdown converted to HTML using svelte-markdown
- **Component Rendering**: Safe HTML rendering through Svelte components
- **Scroll Synchronization**: Preview pane tracks editor scroll position

## Testing Strategy

### Test-Driven Development
- **62 passing tests** covering all core functionality
- **Unit tests** for each command type and manager
- **Integration tests** for component interactions
- **Comprehensive coverage** of edge cases and error conditions

### Test Categories

├── Command interface compliance
├── Undo/redo functionality
├── Batch composition
└── State management

├── Action-type detection
├── Position-jump handling
└── Manual finalization

Markdown Tests:
├── Syntax insertion commands
├── Preview rendering accuracy
├── Scroll synchronization

```

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Svelte 5**: Reactive UI framework with excellent performance
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and enhanced developer experience

## Performance Considerations

### Batching Optimizations
- **Immediate Execution**: Commands execute instantly for UI responsiveness
- **Lazy Batching**: Batches created only when needed

- **Configurable Thresholds**: Tunable parameters for different use cases

### Reactive Updates
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Only affected components update on state changes
- **Store Subscriptions**: Efficient reactive updates via Svelte stores
- **Debounced Operations**: Batch finalization prevents excessive updates
